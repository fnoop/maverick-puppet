# Custom Modules

Maverick provides locations in the Maverick system that are excluded from upstream commits to place custom modules.


## Custom Module Locations

Custom modules can be placed in the Maverick System at ~/software/maverick/manifests/custom-modules. This directory is excluded from commits in .gitignore.

For an external location for other github projects directories or modules outside the Maverick hierarchy, modules can be placed in ~/code/maverick/custom-modules.
